!IMPORTANT FOR FRONTEND!: Https is used and a reverse proxy is setup. The fetch url should be https://galaxycollapse.com/api/some_api . Rginx handles this in it's default file.

In droplet/live:
	Front end: nav to /root/frontend then "npm run build". Then transfer /dist files to 		  /var/www/html
	Back end/ API: replace server.js in /var/cardsServer. Then "pm2 reboot 0"

In local testing:
	Front end: nav to root/frontend/ then "npm run dev" Nodemon should be in-place.
	Back end/ API: nav to root where server.js is located. Then "npm start"
